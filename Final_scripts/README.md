The annealing.py file performs the simulated annealing algorithm.
The main.py file simulates the breeding protocol proposed by Vasconcelos et al.
The b_opt.py file performs the Bayesian optimization.
The cutoff_opt.py file optimises the Fock cut-off value used in the simulations.
The errors.py file calculates the mean values and the standard deviations of the circuit parameters.
The opt_cut_explore.py file plots the minimum cutoff values for different deltas (of the target GKP state) and catstate amplitudes.
The trace_dist_explore.py file plots the parameter space.
All the files whose name starts with "plots" produce the remaining plots used in the report.

The annealing.py file performs the simulated annealing algorithm.

The main.py file simulates the breeding protocol proposed by Vasconcelos et al.

The b_opt.py file performs the Bayesian optimization.

The cutoff_opt.py file optimises the Fock cut-off value used in the simulations.

The errors.py file calculates the mean values and the standard deviations of the circuit parameters.

The opt_cut_explore.py file plots the minimum cutoff values for different deltas (of the target GKP state) and catstate amplitudes.

The trace_dist_explore.py file plots the parameter space.

All the files whose name starts with "plots" produce the remaining plots used in the report.
